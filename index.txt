Welcome to my personal website!

I am currently a third year student at Oregon State University majoring in Computer Science with the Systems option.

Some special CS interests of mine include UI/UX development, database management, and algorithm design. Feel free to check out
the links on the left for more info.

Outside of CS, I really like to read awesome psychology books, run long distances, cycle with friends, and experiment with fashion.
